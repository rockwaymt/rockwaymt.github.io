		<p>Here is how we are handling Covid safety:</p>
<div class="text-left">
<p>You will  be sent covid-19 pre-screening questions to review prior to your appointment.  You must be symptom-free in order to attend.</p>   

<p>Please come as close to your appointment time as possible. When you arrive, please wait outside or in your car. (You will be given instructions prior to your appointment as to the procedure each practitioner is following, ie calling when you have arrived or waiting for your practitioner to contact you to enter.)</p> 

<p>Everyone entering the clinic is required to wear a mask. Masks must be worn during treatment as well, with the exception of skin care appointments.</p>

<p>Please come to your appointment alone if possible, unless you require assistance. We cannot allow guests to wait in the clinic.</p>

<p>Please use provided hand sanitizer when entering and exiting the clinic.</p>

<p>Cleaning of the clinic has been increased to ensure proper disinfecting.</p>
